# symfony-api-example

Symfony is supposed to be a technological detail. Here is my proposal on how to do it. I am trying my best to keep it as
framework agnostic as possible. This is why I moved some classes to `\framework`.

The tests are your documentation.

All suggestions and discussion welcome.

```bash
./dev up
./dev init
```
