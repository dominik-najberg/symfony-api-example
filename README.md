# symfony-api-example

Symfony is supposed to be a technological detail. Here is my proposal on how to do it.

This is as framework agnostic as possible. The framework dependencies are only possible in the UI and Infrastructure layers.
I moved some classes to `\framework` to keep the framework details separate.

Layered architecture. Hexagonal.

The tests are your documentation.

All suggestions and discussion welcome.

```bash
./dev up
./dev init
```
